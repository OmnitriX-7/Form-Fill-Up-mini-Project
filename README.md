# Flask Form Submission Mini Project üìù

This is a mini project using **Flask** that implements a basic form submission system. Users can enter details such as:

- Name
- Password
- Salary
- Gender (Radio button)
- Country (Dropdown)
- Message (Textarea)
- Photo (File upload)

The form is built using **Flask-WTF**, ensuring CSRF protection and clean validation. The password is securely hashed using **Werkzeug**. Upon submission, the data is captured and displayed back to the user.

This project is a great starting point to learn:

- Flask app structure
- Flask-WTF form handling
- Working with various WTForms fields
- File uploads in Flask
- Secure password hashing
